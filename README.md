# Guessing Game


I have used java swing and basic programming to make a guessing game where A user is first explained the rules and then is asked if he wants to play or not . This happens in the main function

If the user agrees to play he is asked to decide the upper limit of the number to be guessed (happens in the getRandomNumber() function).

After this the user has 7 attemps to guess the number as the game function is played.

After each round the user can choose from the menu() to play again , view the scoreboard or exit the program.
